## Evolving Landscape of AI in the LASIK Eye Surgery in Healthcare Industry

AI is reshaping LASIK by improving diagnostic precision, surgical planning, and post-op assessment. AI algorithms can process corneal topography, thickness maps, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans to customize treatment plans for each patient. This helps ophthalmologists determine candidacy for surgery with greater confidence and reduce risks of post-operative complications like dry eye or vision aberrations. AI is also improving laser alignment and focus, reducing procedural variability and improving patient outcomes.

## Emerging AI Technologies Driving the LASIK Eye Surgery Market Forward

Key AI innovations in LASIK include predictive analytics for post-surgery visual acuity, image recognition for eye-tracking and movement correction, and machine learning algorithms for surgical planning based on large datasets of prior outcomes. AI-integrated laser platforms can adjust energy output in real time, improving precision and safety. Augmented reality (AR) tools, powered by AI, are being tested to assist surgeons with guided procedures. AI is also being used in virtual pre-surgery consultations and patient education.

## LASIK Eye Surgery industryâ€™s Recent Statistics (2023â€“2025)
