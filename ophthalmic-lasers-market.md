## Fabry Disease industry Overview: Size and Growth Projections (Global & Regional Insights):

Fabry disease is a rare genetic lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the GLA gene, leading to deficient Î±-galactosidase A enzyme activity. This results in the accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) in blood vessels and organs, causing progressive damage to kidneys, heart, and the nervous system. The market includes enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), chaperone therapy, gene therapy, and diagnostic testing. Increasing awareness, newborn screening initiatives, and advancements in molecular diagnostics are expanding the reach of early treatment and disease management solutions.
